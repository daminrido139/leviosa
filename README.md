## **How It Works**  

1. **Gesture Recognition**:  
   - MediaPipe captures and processes gestures.  
   - Machine learning models classify gestures into words.  

2. **Real-Time Translation**:  
   - Speech or text is converted into 3D animated ISL gestures.  

3. **Document Conversion**:  
   - Text, images, and videos are parsed and mapped to ISL gestures.  

4. **Interactive Learning**:  
   - Students access lessons, assignments, and study materials via the LMS.  
   - Teachers and parents track progress using analytics tools.
